# PepperPal
PepperPal is an application for the Pepper robot which aims to help
autistic children in school. It has the following functionality
* Greeting children by name when they arrive (face recognition in progress)
* Proposing the next item in their routine with voice, tablet and gesture prompts
* Gaining the child's attention when it wanders by performing a funny animation (currently animal impersonations). It does this using the human attention state maintained by Pepper
* Giving children a means to signal when they need assistance (eg don't understand, need bathroom, thirsty) but don't feel comfortable vocalising their need. The application maintains common needs as easy to understand icons on the tablet that a child can select in order to trigger Pepper to make the request on their behalf.
